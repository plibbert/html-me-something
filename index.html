        <header>Oh, The Concerts I Have Seen</header>
        <main>
            <p>Have you ever taken a moment to think back and think about some of the exepriences you've had? I decided do that with the concerts I've attended.</p>
            <p>It's strage to look back and see how my music choices have changed(<em>ish</em>). It all started with an N'Sync concert with my mom at Sandstone Ampitheater when I was in middle school. I felt like the coolest kid at school for getting to see N'Sync LIVE! For that concert and a few others, my mom and I had to stand in line in the mall hours before it opened and just <em>hope</em> the scalpers didn't claim all the tickets before we got to the counter. Eventually the boy band craze subsided and I moved on to being a mopey teenager with music tastes to match. I didn't have to stand in line for concerts anymore - I just had to deal with Ticketmaster and mediocre internet instead. In college I continued to wear my emo heart on my sleeve, but found the local punk scene and loved it too. There is nothing quiet like a punk rock house show. After college, I <em>finally</em> got to see Flogging Molly. They have been a favorite band of mine since around 2004. Now, as a generally functional adult, I still go to shows sometimes. It's definitely not like in college, where I would go to a house show or full blown concert seemingly every other weekend. I hope you are entertained by what I've seen and maybe even get to understand me a little better.</p>
            <p>OH! While you're looking at the list, some of the bands names may be links! I added some fun bits of information or links to webpages here and there.</p>

                <h3 class="favoriteConcerts">Flogging Molly</h3>
                    <h5 class="date">March 2014</h5>
                    <p>I have loved Flogging Molly since the early 2000's. I discovered them through the Dropkick Murphy's (who I discovered only slightly before on a Warped Tour complation album). One of my most favorite songs of all time is "If I Ever Leave This World Alive" and I, should I ever get hitched, I plan to work that into the ceremony somewhere.
                        <br></br>
                    I was lucky enough to see them at the Midland Theater in KC, MO for the first time and then again at Crossroads KC. Both shows were AMAZING. I planned to see them a third time last summer, but financial distress forced me to sell my tickets. That said, I'm already looking for a concert buddy for the next time they roll through Kansas City!

                    <h5 class="date">June 21st, 2005</h5>
                    <p id="concertText">I was a 17 year old emo kid and Warped Tour was mecca. I took the train to St.Louis (my first time alone!) to meet my friend for the show. Neither of us had been to an event like this and it seemed HUGE.</p>
                        <img id="FavsPhoto" src="images/Warped_Tour_2005.JPG"style="width:825px;height:315px;"alt="Battered Ticket from Warped Tour 2005, St.Louis">
                    <p>I fell down in the mosh pit while watching My Chemical Romance (yes, they had a mosh pit), watched my friend do the same in the crowd for Matchbook Romance. We chilled at a small ampitheater spot and watched bands that would later become favorites. We both got insanely dehytrated, shared water with complete strangers, and bummed sunscreen off a harried mom trying to wrangle her tween charges. We left sweaty, sunburned, covered in beer and other people's sweat, and excited to do it all again as soon as possible. We decided then to do it again the next year (I ended up going alone due to some suprise circumstances).</p>

                <h3 class="favoriteConcerts">The Aquabats & Reel Big Fish</h3>
                    <h5 class="date">July 2019</h5>
                    <p id="concertText">I found out about this show 8 hours before it was taking place and bought a ticket without hesitation. It was one of the best decisons I've made in a long time. I may not know every song, but the Aquabats hold a special, silly place in my pea-little-heart and Reel Big Fish's "Fuck You" cheered me up on some remarkably shitty days.</p>

                    <p>By the time I attended this show, I considered myself a seasoned concert going veteran. So I pulled on my rattiest pair of Chucks (with inserts because I'm old now) and prepared for punk show battle. What I encountered was not a rowdy group of ska kids (turned adult) skanking into any and everyone nearby, nor was it a danger zone of mosh/circle pit action with stray fists flying out in all directions. Instead, it was one of the most entertaining shows I've experienced. Yes, there were some skankers and a couple brief "pits", but there were also giant inflatable sharks bouncing around the jumping crowd. <em>Kids</em> crowd surfing on giant inflatable pizza slices. And then, Reel Big Fish played the same song several times in diferent genres - expecting the crowd to dance accordingly. I have seen many silly things at concerts - but you have not lived until you've seen a "Ska Guy" trying to figure out how to skank to a country ballad, it's hilarious. Seriously, one of the best shows of my life. I sincerly hope to see both bands again...soon!

                <h3 class="favoriteConcerts">The Reverand Horton Heat</h3>
                    <h5 class="date">Summer 2005</h5>
                    <p id="concertText">I was first introducted to the Rev on yet another compilation CD in the early 2000's. I'm not even sure what that song was, but they rolled through Colulmbia, MO and I decided to check them out. This was a most excellent decison, as they remain the band I have seen live the most times (5) and I wouldn't mind catching another show!</p>
                        <img id="FavsPhoto" src="images/TheRev.jpg" alt="Jim Heath, lead singer/guitarist for The Reverand Horton Heat surfing on the upright bass of Jimbo Wallace at a live performance at the Blue Note in Columbia, MO" style="width:425px;height:315px;">
                    <p>Jimbo (upright bass) and the Rev do this really nifty thing at most shows, where they lean the bass to the side and the Rev climbs on to "surf" while both continue to play. The showmanship is awesome. The shows themselves are fun and not overly exhausting.

                    <h5 class="date">October 10th, 2005</h5>
                    <p>This was the first show I went to in college. It was my birthday. It was snowing. It was also my first <em>real</em> punk show (I'm not counting Warped Tour).
                        <br></br>
                    I saw them at a local Laramie bar known as the 2nd street Cowboy (there were two bars in Laramie named "The Cowboy" so we distinguished them by their cross street). They didn't really have a "stage" so much as a raised platform, so if you were in front you were basically face to chest with the band. It was wild. There were people randomly getting on the stage and a few were (somehow) crowdsurfing. There was lots of moshing/circling. It was awesome.

                <h3 class="favoriteConcerts">Honorable Mention: Teenage Bottlerocket</h3>
                    <h5 class="date">Various Dates (2005-2010)</h5>
                    <p>I during college, I was fortunate enough to meet and become friends with many people in the Laramie "punk scene". Many of the house shows I attended were those of friends and local bands like Mr. V, Redbush, Sprocket Nova, Juice Falcon, and more. One of those bands - Teenage Bottlerocket - blew up shortly after I left Wyoming. They were signed and have been touring nationally and internationally ever since! 
                        <br></br>
                    Rarely do I get to see myself as "cool" but saying that I have hung out with, drank with, and/or been friends with people in a popualr band definitely makes me feel <em>cool</em>. Plus, I can say I partied at the house of their bassist's dad - and that same dad was my College Algebra professor!
